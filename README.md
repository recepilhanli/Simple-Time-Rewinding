# Unreal Engine C++ Simple Time Rewinding System

This system implements a time rewind system in Unreal Engine, allowing game players to rewind time.

## Features
- High-performance time rewind algorithm.
- Easy integration and customization.
- Can be attached to any actor (character, typical actor etc..) as an actor component.

## Known Issues
-  Rewinding action is not smooth because we are spamming set location/rotation/scale; we need to perform the rewinding action using splines.
